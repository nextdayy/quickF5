# QuickF5 by nextdaydelivery
## This mod is now archived! Please go to https://github.com/Polyfrost/BehindYouV3 for a new rewritten version.
QuickF5 is simple, legit and free alternative to PerspectiveMod that allows toggling/holding in a different perspective.
This mod does a very good job at providing a legitimate alternative to PerspectiveMod, allowing for easier viewing of nearby players while bridging, or whenever you want to use it. Its very useful in PvP senarios like BedWars and SkyWars, and even for general use. Optimized to work well on the Hypixel server and isn't banned!
Also, No ghost chunks when turning around unlike PerspectiveMod, they load instantly and compatible with OptiFine zoom!
